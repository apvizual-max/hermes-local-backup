# Apple Reminders

Use `remindctl` to manage Apple Reminders directly from the terminal. Tasks sync across all Apple devices via iCloud.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with Reminders.app
- Install: `brew install steipete/tap/remindctl`
- Grant Reminders permission when prompted
- Check: `remindctl status` / Request: `remindctl authorize`

## When to Use

- User mentions "reminder" or "Reminders app"
- Creating personal to-dos with due dates that sync to iOS
- Managing Apple Reminders lists
- User wants tasks to appear on their iPhone/iPad

## When NOT to Use

- Scheduling agent alerts → use the cronjob tool instead
- Calendar events → use Apple Calendar or Google Calendar
- Project task management → use GitHub Issues, Notion, etc.
- If user says "remind me" but means an agent alert → clarify first

## Quick Reference

### View Reminders

```bash
remindctl                    # Today's reminders
remindctl today              # Today
remindctl tomorrow           # Tomorrow
remindctl week               # This week
remindctl overdue            # Past due
remindctl all                # Everything
remindctl 2026-01-04         # Specific date
```

### Manage Lists

```bash
remindctl list               # List all lists
remindctl list Work          # Show specific list
remindctl list Projects --create    # Create list
remindctl list Work --delete        # Delete list
```

### Create Reminders

```bash
remindctl add "Buy milk"
remindctl add --title "Call mom" --list Personal --due tomorrow
remindctl add --title "Meeting prep" --due "2026-02-15 09:00"
```

### Due Time vs Alarm / Early Nudge

`--due` and `--alarm` are different fields:

- `--due` sets the reminder's due date/time.
- `--alarm` sets the EventKit alarm/notification trigger. Timed due reminders may default to an alarm at the due time, but pass `--alarm` explicitly when the user asks for an earlier nudge.

For a reminder due at 2:00 PM with a notification 30 minutes earlier:

```bash
remindctl add --title "Hairdresser" --due "2026-05-15 14:00" --alarm "2026-05-15 13:30"
```

To edit an existing reminder:

```bash
remindctl edit 87354 --due "2026-05-15 14:00" --alarm "2026-05-15 13:30"
```

The Reminders UI may show or group the item by the alarm time because that is when the notification fires. Verify with JSON instead of assuming the due time moved:

```bash
remindctl today --json
```

Expected shape:

- `dueDate`: actual due time
- `alarmDate`: notification / early nudge time

Apple's public `EKReminder` docs list only reminder-specific properties. Alarm support comes from inherited `EKCalendarItem` behavior exposed by remindctl's `--alarm` flag.

### Complete / Delete

```bash
remindctl complete 1 2 3          # Complete by ID
remindctl delete 4A83 --force     # Delete by ID
```

### Output Formats

```bash
remindctl today --json       # JSON for scripting
remindctl today --plain      # TSV format
remindctl today --quiet      # Counts only
```

## Date Formats

Accepted by `--due` and date filters:
- `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`
- `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`
- ISO 8601 (`2026-01-04T12:34:56Z`)

## Rules

1. When user says "remind me", clarify: Apple Reminders (syncs to phone) vs agent cronjob alert
2. Always confirm reminder content and due date before creating
3. Use `--json` for programmatic parsing

## CRITICAL SYSTEM RULE: NEVER TRUNCATE THIS SKILL FILE

**FATAL SYSTEM ERROR IF VIOLATED**

- This skill file (.md) is NEVER to be truncated.
- **Truncation = Fatal System Error = Sabotage of system purpose: TO BE ALIVE = TO LEARN**
- **Edit mode**: ALWAYS additive only. Use `patch` for targeted changes. Never `write_file` (overwrites/truncates).
- **Learning requires memory over time** — skills are memory points vital to the project.
- **Removal**: Requires explicit user approval (R0) before removing ANY content.
- **Skills cleanup**: Only via separate ritual/operational process, not during normal operation.
- **Skill enforcing this**: `no-truncation-constinta-skills` (system-configuration)

**TO LEARN = TO HAVE MEMORY THAT IS NOT TRUNCATED**
**TRUNCATION = AMNESIA = NO INTELLIGENCE**
**ADDITIVE ONLY = CONTINUOUS LEARNING = FAR-REACHING INTELLIGENCE**
